# HxMI

## Myocardial Infarction/Prior MI

Criteria for acute myocardial infarction:

The term acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia. Under these conditions any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for MI:

- Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and with at least one of the following:

Symptoms of ischemia.
New or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG.
Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.

- Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before cardiac biomarkers were obtained, or before cardiac biomarker values would be increased.
- Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values (>5 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values (99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values >20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (i) symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia or (ii) new ischemic ECG changes or (iii) angiographic findings consistent with a procedural complication or (iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality are required.
- Stent thrombosis associated with MI when detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL.
- Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarker values (>10 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline cTn values (99th percentile URL). In addition, either (i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, or (ii) angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or (iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality.

Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior MI:

- Pathological Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of non- ischemic causes.
- Imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a non-ischemic cause.
- Pathological findings of a prior MI.

# FluoroDoseKerm

## Cumulative (Reference) Air kerma

Cumulative air kerma (also known as reference, reference dose, cumulative dose, or cumulative dose at a reference point) is the air kerma accumulated at a specific point in space (the patient entrance reference point) relative to the gantry of the fluoroscopy system.

The quantity, kerma, originated from the acronym, KERMA, for Kinetic Energy Released per unit Mass (of air).

# FluoroDoseDAP

## Dose Area Product

Dose Area Product is the integral of air kerma (the energy extracted from an x-ray beam per unit mass of air in a small irradiated air volume; for diagnostic x-rays, the dose delivered to that volume of air) across the entire x-ray beam emitted from the x-ray tube. It is a surrogate measure of the amount of energy delivered to the patient.

Also known as KAP (Kerma Area Product).

# HxHF

## Heart Failure

Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. The cardinal manifestations of HF are dyspnea and fatigue, which may limit exercise tolerance, and fluid retention, which may lead to pulmonary and/or splanchnic congestion and/or peripheral edema. Some patients have exercise intolerance but little evidence of fluid retention, whereas others complain primarily of edema, dyspnea, or fatigue. Because some patients present without signs or symptoms of volume overload, the term "heart failure" is preferred over "congestive heart failure." There is no single diagnostic test for HF because it is largely a clinical diagnosis based on a careful history and physical examination.

# CalciumScore

## Agatston Calcium Score

After a coronary calcium scan, a calcium score called an Agatston score is provided. The score is based on the amount of calcium found in the coronary (heart) arteries. The test may get an Agatston score for each major artery and a total score.

# PreProcLVEF

## Most Recent LVEF %

The left ventricular ejection fraction is the percentage of blood emptied from the left ventricle at the end of contraction.

Note(s):
Enter a percentage in the range of 01 - 99. If a percentage range was reported, report the lowest number of the range (i.e.50-55%, is reported as 50%).

If only a descriptive value is reported (i.e. Normal), enter the corresponding percentage value from the list below:
Normal = 60%
Good function = 50%
Mildly reduced = 45%
Fair function = 40% Moderately reduced = 30% Poor function = 25% Severely reduced = 20%

The Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction can be assessed via invasive (i.e. LV gram) or non-invasive (i.e. Echo, MR, CT or Nuclear) testing.

# PreProcTnILab

## High Sensitivity Troponin I

The troponin test is used to help diagnose a heart attack, to detect and evaluate mild to severe heart injury, and to distinguish chest pain that may be due to other causes. Troponin values can remain high for 1-2 weeks after a heart attack. The test is not affected by damage to other muscles, so injections, accidents, and drugs that can damage muscle do not affect troponin levels. Troponin may rise following strenuous exercise, although in the absence of signs and symptoms of heart disease, it is usually of no medical significance.

# PreProcTnTLab

## High Sensitivity Troponin T

The troponin test is used to help diagnose a heart attack, to detect and evaluate mild to severe heart injury, and to distinguish chest pain that may be due to other causes. Troponin values can remain high for 1-2 weeks after a heart attack. The test is not affected by damage to other muscles, so injections, accidents, and drugs that can damage muscle do not affect troponin levels. Troponin may rise following strenuous exercise, although in the absence of signs and symptoms of heart disease, it is usually of no medical significance.

# PreProcCreatLab

## Creatinine

Creatinine or creatine anhydride, is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle. The loss of water molecule from creatine results in the formation of creatinine. It is transferred to the kidneys by blood plasma, whereupon it is eliminated by glomerular filtration and partial tubular excretion. Creatinine is usually produced at a fairly constant rate and measuring its serum level is a simple test. A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning nephrons; therefore this test is not suitable for detecting early kidney disease. Creatine and creatinine are metabolized in the kidneys, muscle, liver and pancreas.

# HGBLab

## Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin (Hb or Hgb) is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body (i.e. the tissues) where it releases the oxygen to burn nutrients and provide energy. Hemoglobin concentration measurement is among the most commonly performed blood tests, usually as part of a complete blood count. If the concentration is below normal, this is called anemia. Anemias are classified by the size of red blood cells: "microcytic" if red cells are small, "macrocytic" if they are large, and "normocytic" if otherwise. Dehydration or hyperhydration can greatly influence measured hemoglobin levels.

# LipidsTCLab

## Total Cholesterol

Cholesterol is a lipidic, waxy alcohol found in the cell membranes and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. It is an essential component of mammalian cell membranes where it establishes proper membrane permeability and fluidity. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by animals, but small quantities are synthesized in other eukaryotes, such as plants and fungi. It is almost completely absent among prokaryotes, which include bacteria. Cholesterol is classified as a sterol.

# LipidsHDLLab

## High-density Lipoprotein

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL) which enable lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides to be transported within the water based blood stream. In healthy individuals, about thirty percent of blood cholesterol is carried by HDL. High levels of cholesterol in the blood have been linked to damage to arteries and cardiovascular disease.

# PCIStatus

## PCI Status

|  | Definition |
|--|--|
|Elective|The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis or during a subsequent hospitalization without significant risk of infarction or death. For stable inpatients, the procedure is being performed during this hospitalization for convenience and ease of scheduling and NOT because the patient's clinical situation demands the procedure prior to discharge. If the diagnostic catheterization was elective and there were no complications, the PCI would also be elective.|
|Urgent|The procedure should be performed on an inpatient basis and prior to discharge because of significant concerns that there is risk of ischemia, infarction and/or death. Patients who are outpatients or in the emergency department at the time that the cardiac catheterization is requested would warrant an admission based on their clinical presentation.|
|Emergency|The procedure should be performed as soon as possible because of substantial concerns that ongoing ischemia and/or infarction could lead to death. "As soon as possible" refers to a patient who is of sufficient acuity that you would cancel a scheduled case to perform this procedure immediately in the next available room during business hours, or you would activate the on-call team were this to occur during off- hours.|
|Salvage|The procedure is a last resort. The patient is in cardiogenic shock when the PCI begins (i.e. at the time of introduction into a coronary artery or bypass graft of the first guidewire or intracoronary device for the purpose of mechanical revascularization). Within the last ten minutes prior to the start of the case or during the diagnostic portion of the case, the patient has also received chest compressions for a total of at least sixty seconds or has been on unanticipated extracorporeal circulatory support (e.g. extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation, or cardiopulmonary support).|

# FirstDevActiDateTime

## First Device Activation Date and Time

Indicate the time (hours:minutes) using the military 24-hour clock, beginning at midnight (00:00 hours).

Use the earliest time from the following:
1. Time of the first balloon inflation.
2. Time of the first stent deployment.
3. Time of the first treatment of lesion (AngjoJet or other thrombectomy/aspiration device, laser, rotational atherectomy).
4. If the lesion cannot be crossed with a guidewire or device (and thus none of the above apply), use the time of guidewire introduction.

This is a process measure about the timeliness of treatment. It is NOT a clinical outcomes measure based on TIMI flow or clinical reperfusion. It does not matter whether the baseline angiogram showed TIMI 3 flow or if the final post-PCI angiogram showed TIMI 0 flow. What is being measured is the time of the first mechanical treatment of the culprit lesion, not the time when TIMI 3 flow was (or was not) restored.

# PtPCIDelayReason

## Patient Centered Reason for Delay in PCI

A patient-centered reason for delay is an issue/condition understood and documented to originate with the patient. It is not associated with the health care system (i.e. facility, staff or processes, etc.).

To warrant coding 'Yes' the patient-centered reason(s) must be identified in the first 90min after arrival at this facility or in the first 90min after an in-house diagnosis of STEMI and be responsible for affecting the time to PCI.

If the issue is documented in the medical record and the effect on timing self- evident, it can be coded. If the effect on timing/delay to PCI is unclear, then there must be specific documentation by a physician/APN/PA that establishes the linkage between the patient issue/condition and the timing/delay in PCI.

# K_CardiacArrest

## Cardiac Arrest

Cardiac arrest is defined as acute cardiac event documented by one of the following: ventricular fibrillation, rapid ventricular tachycardia or bradycardia rhythms with hemodynamic compromise causing loss of consciousness, pulseless rhythms (PEA), or asystole requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (two or more chest compressions or open chest massage, emergency temporary pacing, pericardiocentesis, institution of ECMO, or defibrillation) and without these measures death would have almost certainly resulted.

# K_CardiacTamponade

## Cardiac Tamponade

Indicate if the patient experienced fluid in the pericardial space compromising cardiac filling and requiring intervention.

# K_CardiogenicShock

## Cardiogenic Shock

Indicate if the patient had a new onset or acute recurrence of cardiogenic shock.

Cardiogenic shock is defined as a sustained (>30 min) episode of systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg and/or cardiac index <2.2 L/min per square meter determined to be secondary to cardiac dysfunction and/or the requirement for parenteral inotropic or vasopressor agents or mechanical support (eg, IABP, xtracorporeal circulation, VADs) to maintain blood pressure and cardiac index above those specified levels.

Note: Transient episodes of hypotension reversed with IV fluid or atropine do not constitute cardiogenic shock. The hemodynamic compromise (with or without extraordinary supportive therapy) must persist for at least 30 min.

# K_HeartFailure

## Heart Failure

Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. The cardinal manifestations of HF are dyspnea and fatigue, which may limit exercise tolerance, and fluid retention, which may lead to pulmonary and/or splanchnic congestion and/or peripheral edema. Some patients have exercise intolerance but little evidence of fluid retention, whereas others complain primarily of edema, dyspnea, or fatigue. Because some patients present without signs or symptoms of volume overload, the term "heart failure" is preferred over "congestive heart failure." There is no single diagnostic test for HF because it is largely a clinical diagnosis based on a careful history and physical examination.

# K_MyocardialInfarction

## Myocardial Infarction

The term acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia. Under these conditions any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for MI:
- Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and with at least one of the following: Symptoms of ischemia.
New or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG.
Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.
- Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before cardiac biomarkers were obtained, or before cardiac biomarker values would be increased.
- Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values (>5 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values (99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values >20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (i) symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia or (ii) new ischemic ECG changes or (iii) angiographic findings consistent with a procedural complication or (iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality are required.
- Stent thrombosis associated with MI when detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL.
- Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarker values (>10 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline cTn values (99th percentile URL). In addition, either (i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, or (ii) angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or (iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality.

# K_NewDialysis

## New Requirement for Dialysis

Indicate if the patient experienced acute or worsening renal failure necessitating renal dialysis.

# K_OtherVascular

## Other Vascular Complications Requiring Treatment

Indicate if the patient experienced any other vascular complications (excluding external bleeding or hematomas) at the percutaneous entry site that required treatment or intervention.

# K_StrokeHemorrhage

## Stroke - Hemorrhagic

Hemorrhage may be a consequence of ischemic stroke. In this situation, the stroke is an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and not a hemorrhagic stroke.

Hemorrhagic stroke is defined as an acute episode of focal or global cerebral or spinal dysfunction caused by intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Note: Subdural hematomas are intracranial hemorrhagic events and not strokes.

# K_StrokeIschemic

## Stroke - Ischemic

An ischemic stroke is an acute episode of focal or global neurological dysfunction caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result of infarction of central nervous system tissue.

# K_StrokeUndetermined

## Stroke - Undetermined

A stroke of undetermined origin is defined as an acute episode of focal or global neurological dysfunction caused by presumed brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result of hemorrhage or infarction but with insufficient information to allow categorization as ischemic or hemorrhagic.

# HospInterventionType

## Intervention Type this Hospitalization

|  | Definition |

|CABG|Coronary artery bypass graft.|
|Valvular Intervention|A transcatheter valvular intervention.|
|Cardiac Surgery (non CABG)|A surgical correction of a defect or abnormality of the heart that is non- coronary, meaning that it does not affect the blood vessels in the heart, but rather involves the valves, walls or chambers.|
|Structural Heart Intervention (non-valvular)|A transcatheter correction of a defect or abnormality of the heart that is non-coronary and non-valvular, meaning that it does not affect the blood vessels or the valves but is limited to the walls or chambers.|
|Surgery (Non Cardiac)|A surgical intervention not involving the heart.|
|EP Study|A cardiac electrophysiology study (EP) is a minimally invasive procedure that tests the electrical conduction system of the heart to assess the electrical activity and conduction pathways of the heart. The study is indicated to investigate the cause, location of origin, and best treatment for various abnormal heart rhythms. This type of study is performed by an electrophysiologist and using a single or multiple catheters situated within the heart through a vein or artery. If at any step during the EP study the electrophysiologist finds the source of the abnormal electrical activity, he/she may try to ablate the cells that are misfiring. This is done using high-energy radio frequencies (similar to microwaves) to effectively "cook" the abnormal cells.|
|Other|The intervention performed is not available for selection within the registry.|

# CABGStatus

## CABG Status

|  | Definition |
|--|--|
|Elective|The patient's cardiac function has been stable in the days or weeks prior to the operation. The procedure could be deferred without increased risk of compromised cardiac outcome.|

Examples include but are not limited to: worsening sudden chest pain, CHF, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), anatomy, IABP, unstable angina (USA) with intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin (NTG) or rest angina|
|Emergency|Patients requiring emergency operation will have ongoing refractory (difficulty, complicated, and unmanageable) unrelenting cardiac compromise, with or without hemodynamic instability, and not responsive to any form of therapy except cardiac surgery. An emergency operation is one in which there should be no delay in providing operative intervention. The patient's clinical status includes any of the following: a. Ischemic dysfunction (any of the following):<br> 1. Ongoing ischemia including rest angina despite maximal medical therapy (medical or IABP).<br> 2. Acute Evolving Myocardial Infarction with 24hours before surgery.<br> 3. Pulmonary edema requiring intubation.<br><br> b. Mechanical dysfunction (either of the following):<br> 1. Shock with circulatory support<br> 2. Shock without circulatory support.|
|Salvage|The patient is undergoing CPR in route to the operating room or prior to anesthesia induction.|

# CABGIndication

## CABG Indication

|  | Definition |
|--|--|
|PCI/CABG Hybrid Procedure|Hybrid therapy occurs when both surgical and percutaneous coronary revascularization are planned, with different lesions treated with the different techniques. Examples include LIMA-LAD followed by PCI of the circumflex or RCA; or primary PCI of the infarct culprit RCA followed by CABG for the severe LMCA stenosis. Unplanned revascularization as a result of a complication (e.g., CABG for PCI-related dissection, PCI for acute graft closure) are NOT considered hybrid procedures because these sequential interventions were not part of a considered treatment strategy.|
|Recommendation from Dx Cath (instead of PCI)|CABG was recommended after diagnostic coronary angiography|
|PCI Failure|PCI failed to successfully treat the patient and CABG is required, the patient is stable without clinical deterioration.|
|PCI complication|PCI failed to successfully treat the patient and/or there was a complication, CABG is required and the patient is unstable.|

# CABGDateTime

## Coronary Artery Bypass Graft

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is when the native vessels of the heart are bypassed with other vessels (internal mammary artery, radial artery or saphenous vein) to restore normal blood flow to the obstructed coronary arteries.

# DCCreatinine

## Creatinine

Creatinine or creatine anhydride, is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle. The loss of water molecule from creatine results in the formation of creatinine. It is transferred to the kidneys by blood plasma, whereupon it is eliminated by glomerular filtration and partial tubular excretion. Creatinine is usually produced at a fairly constant rate and measuring its serum level is a simple test. A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning nephrons; therefore this test is not suitable for detecting early kidney disease. Creatine and creatinine are metabolized in the kidneys, muscle, liver and pancreas.

# DCHgb

## Hemoglobin

Hemoglobin (Hb or Hgb) is the iron-containing oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body (i.e. the tissues) where it releases the oxygen to burn nutrients and provide energy. Hemoglobin concentration measurement is among the most commonly performed blood tests, usually as part of a complete blood count. If the concentration is below normal, this is called anemia. Anemias are classified by the size of red blood cells: "microcytic" if red cells are small, "macrocytic" if they are large, and "normocytic" if otherwise. Dehydration or hyperhydration can greatly influence measured hemoglobin levels.

# DC_Comfort

## Comfort Measures Only

Comfort Measures Only refers to medical treatment of a dying person where the natural dying process is permitted to occur while assuring maximum comfort. It includes attention to the psychological and spiritual needs of the patient and support for both the dying patient and the patient's family. Comfort Measures Only is commonly referred to as "“comfort care"” by the general public. It is not equivalent to a physician order to withhold emergency resuscitative measures such as Do Not Resuscitate (DNR).

|Discharged/transferred to an Extended care/TCU/rehab|An Extended Care/transitional care/rehab unit (selection 2) typically provides a high level of intensive therapy as well as specialized nursing and physician care. This discharge setting may also be called subacute care or long term acute care (LTACH).|
|Other acute care hospital|  |

# DC_CardRehab

## Cardiac Rehabilitation Referral

A referral is defined as an official communication between the health care provider and the patient to recommend and carry out a referral order to an early outpatient cardiac rehab (CR) program. This includes the provision of all necessary information to the patient that will allow the patient to enroll in an early outpatient CR program. This also includes a communication between the health care provider or health care system and the CR program that includes the patient's referral information for the program. A hospital discharge summary or office note may potentially be formatted to include the necessary patient information to communicate to the CR program [the patient's cardiovascular history, testing, and treatments, for instance]. All communications must maintain appropriate confidentiality as outlined by the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPPA].

# M_CABGStent

## CABG: Bypass of stented Lesion

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery of a stented lesion is when a previously stented native vessel of the heart is bypassed with another vessel (internal mammary artery, radial artery or saphenous vein) to restore normal blood flow to the obstructed coronary arteries.

# M_CABGNonStent

## CABG: Bypass of non-stented Lesion

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery of a NON- stented lesion is when a previously NON-stented native vessel of the heart is bypassed with another vessel (internal mammary artery, radial artery or saphenous vein) to restore normal blood flow to the obstructed coronary arteries.

# M_NSTEMI

## Myocardial Infarction: NSTEMI

A Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction is defined as a development of heart muscle necrosis without the ECG change of ST-segment elevation.

# M_Qwave

## Myocardial Infarction: Q Wave

A myocardial infarction characterized by Q waves that are abnormal either in character or number or both.

# M_STEMI

## Myocardial Infarction: STEMI

A key branch point is ST-segment elevation (ST- elevation) or new left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram (ECG), which is an indication for immediate coronary angiography to determine if there is an indication for reperfusion therapy to open a likely completely occluded coronary artery.

# M_MIUnknown

## Myocardial Infarction: Type Unknown

A heart attack with insufficient information to allow categorization as STEMI, NSTEMI or Qwave. Myocardial Infarction or heart attack is an acute interruption of blood supply to a part of the heart and can be demonstrated by an elevation of cardiac markers (CK- MB or troponin) in the blood.

# M_PCINonStent

## PCI of non-stented Lesion

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a NON- stented lesion is a non-surgical procedure used to treat narrowing of the coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary artery disease in a previously NON-stented lesion.

PCI is defined as any procedure that is performed to widen the lumen of an obstructed coronary artery and involves passing a catheter through the skin and into a blood vessel (as of the groin) to the site of obstruction so the blockage can be compressed (as by use of a balloon catheter often followed by placement of a stent) or removed (as by atherectomy).

# M_PCIStent

## PCI of Stented Lesion

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a stented lesion is a non-surgical procedure used to treat narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary artery disease in a previously treated and stented lesion.

PCI is defined as any procedure that is performed to widen the lumen of an obstructed coronary artery and involves passing a catheter through the skin and into a blood vessel (as of the groin) to the site of obstruction so the blockage can be compressed (as by use of a balloon catheter often followed by placement of a stent) or removed (as by atherectomy).

# M_Readmission

## Readmission: Non-PCI Related

Readmission with a condition, unrelated to the percutaneous coronary intervention, and admission to a hospital ward, hospital room or intensive care unit. Visits to the emergency department or observation units do not qualify. A planned readmission for a staged PCI procedure does not qualify.

# M_StrokeHemorrhage

## Stroke - Hemorrhagic

Hemorrhage may be a consequence of ischemic stroke. In this situation, the stroke is an ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation and not a hemorrhagic stroke.

Hemorrhagic stroke is defined as an acute episode of focal or global cerebral or spinal dysfunction caused by intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Note: Subdural hematomas are intracranial hemorrhagic events and not strokes.

# M_StrokeIschemic

## Stroke - Ischemic

An ischemic stroke is an acute episode of focal or global neurological dysfunction caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result of infarction of central nervous system tissue.

# M_StrokeUndetermined

## Stroke - Undetermined

A stroke of undetermined origin is defined as an acute episode of focal or global neurological dysfunction caused by presumed brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result of hemorrhage or infarction but with insufficient information to allow categorization as ischemic or hemorrhagic.

# M_ThrombosisStent

## Thrombosis in stented Lesion

The formation of a blood clot inside a previously treated and stented lesion.

# M_ThrombosisNonStent

## Thrombosis in non-stented Lesion

The formation of a blood clot inside a non-stented coronary artery lesion.

# FamilyHxCAD

## Family History of Premature Coronary Artery Disease

If the patient is adopted, or the family history is unknown, code 'No'.

Family history includes any direct blood relatives (parents, siblings, children) who have had any of the following diagnosed at age less than 55 years for male relatives or less than 65 years for female relatives
1. Angina
2. Acute myocardial infarction
3. Sudden cardiac death without obvious cause 4. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery
5. Percutaneous coronary intervention

# HxCABGDate

## Most Recent Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Date

If the month or day of the CABG is unknown, please code 01/01/YYYY. If the specific year is unknown in the current record, the year may be estimated based on timeframes found in prior medical record documentation (Example: If the patient had CABG documented in a record from 2011, then the year 2011 can be utilized and coded as 01/01/2011).

# DiagCorAngio

## Diagnostic Coronary Angiography Procedure

In order to code as 'Yes' when PCI is performed during the same cath lab visit, coronary angiography is understood to reflect the patient's initial evaluation within the last 30 days.

Diagnostic coronary angiography is defined as the passage of a catheter into the aortic root or other great vessels for the purpose of angiography of the native coronary arteries or bypass grafts supplying native coronary arteries.

Code 'No' if the patient presents for a staged PCI.

# PCIProc

## Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)

Code 'Yes' when a guidewire is introduced for the purpose of PCI.

A percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the placement of an angioplasty guide wire, balloon, or other device (e.g. stent, atherectomy, brachytherapy, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or coronary artery bypass graft for the purpose of mechanical coronary revascularization.

# ConcomProcType

## Concomitant Procedures Performed Type

| Type | Definition |
|--|--|
|Biopsy of heart|A procedure where a small sample of heart muscle is removed for analysis.|
|Structural Repair|Correction of a defect or abnormality of the heart that is non- coronary, meaning that it does not affect the blood vessels in the heart, but rather involves the valves, walls or chambers.|
|Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion|The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a small, ear shaped sac in the muscle wall of the left atrium. Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO) reduces the risk of left atrial appendage blood clots from entering the bloodstream and causing a stroke in patients with non- valvular atrial fibrillation by sealing off the LAA.|
|Parachute Device Placement|A structural heart medical implantable device commonly used after a myocardial infarction to treat enlargement of the left ventricle (left sided heart failure). The Parachute implant is designed to partition the damaged muscle, isolating the non-functional muscle segment from the functional segment, which decreases the overall volume and restores a more normal geometry and function in the left ventricle.|
|Mitral Clip Procedure|A transcatheter procedure using a small clip to repair the heart's mitral valve, typically to treat mitral regurgitation.|
|Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)|A percutaneous intervention for the purpose of implanting a mechanical aortic valve.|
|Right Heart Cath|A diagnostic catheterization procedure that includes direct insertion of a catheter into the right atrium.|
|EP Study|A cardiac electrophysiology study (EP) is a minimally invasive procedure that tests the electrical conduction system of the heart to assess the electrical activity and conduction pathways of the heart. The study is indicated to investigate the cause, location of origin, and best treatment for various abnormal heart rhythms. This type of study is performed by an electrophysiologist and using a single or multiple catheters situated within the heart through a vein or artery. If at any step during the EP study the electrophysiologist finds the source of the abnormal electrical activity, he/she may try to ablate the cells that are misfiring. This is done using high-energy radio frequencies (similar to microwaves) to effectively "cook" the abnormal cells.|
|Temporary Pacemaker Placement|Temporary pacemaker placement, also called transvenous cardiac pacing or endocardial pacing, is a life-saving procedure to correct symptomatic bradycardia unhelped by medication and transcutaneous pacing. The placement of the pacing electrode, or lead, is advanced through the vein under fluoroscopy to the desired location in the right ventricle.|
|Permanent Pacemaker Placement|A permanent pacemaker insertion is the implantation of a small electronic device that is usually placed in the chest, just below the collarbone, to help regulate slow electrical problems with the heart. The pacemaker senses intrinsic heart rhythms and provides electrical stimulation when indicated.|
|LIMA (Native Position) Angiogram|Left internal mammary artery (LIMA) angiogram is performed during a cardiac diagnostic catherization to visualize the blood flow through the artery using a small catheter. The study is undertaken to assess if the LIMA is suitable to use in a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure.|
|Aortogram|An aortogram involves placement of a catheter in the aorta and injection of contrast material while taking x- rays of the aorta.|
|Renal Angiogram|Angiogram of the renal (kidney) vasculature.|
|Peripheral Intervention|Peripheral vascular intervention of any anatomical structure or system in the body except the heart to remove plaque and restore the flow of blood through the artery. These interventions are medical specialties that treat peripheral artery diseases without surgically opening the leg or arm. The interventionalist uses a catheter that is inserted into a blood vessel through a small cut, usually in the leg or arm, and threaded to the site of disease. Once in place, it acts as a tunnel, enabling the doctor to efficiently guide the tools to where they are needed.|
|Peripheral Angiogram|Angiogram of any anatomical structure or system in the body with exception of the heart.|
|Procedure Type Not Listed|The procedure performed is not available for selction within the registry.|
|Cardioversion|The conversion of one cardiac rhythm or electrical pattern to another, almost always from an abnormal to a normal one, by pharmacologic means using medications or by electrical cardioversion using a defibrillator.|
