# Hypertension

## Hypertension

Hypertension is defined by any one of the following:

1. History of hypertension diagnosed and treated with medication, diet and/or exercise
2. Prior documentation of blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg systolic and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic for patients without diabetes or chronic kidney disease, or prior documentation of blood pressure greater than 130 mm Hg systolic and/or 80 mm Hg diastolic on at least two occasions for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease
3. Currently on pharmacologic therapy for treatment of hypertension.

# Dyslipidemia

## Dyslipidemia

National Cholesterol Education Program criteria include documentation of the following:

1. Total cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/l); or
2. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/l); or,
3. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/l).
For patients with known coronary artery disease, treatment is initiated if LDL is greater than 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/l), and this would qualify as hypercholesterolemia

# HxMI

## Myocardial Infarction/Prior MI

Criteria for acute myocardial infarction:

The term acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia. Under these conditions any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for MI:

- Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and with at least one of the following:

Symptoms of ischemia.
New or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG.
Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality. Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.

- Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before cardiac biomarkers were obtained, or before cardiac biomarker values would be increased.
- Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values (>5 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values (99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values >20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (i) symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia or (ii) new ischemic ECG changes or (iii) angiographic findings consistent with a procedural complication or (iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality are required.
- Stent thrombosis associated with MI when detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischemia and with a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL.
- Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cardiac biomarker values (>10 x 99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline cTn values (99th percentile URL). In addition, either (i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, or (ii) angiographic documented new graft or new native coronary artery occlusion, or (iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality.

Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior MI:

- Pathological Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of non- ischemic causes.
- Imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a non-ischemic cause.
- Pathological findings of a prior MI.

# HxCVD

## Cerebrovascular Disease

Current or previous history of any of the following:

- Ischemic stroke: infarction of central nervous system tissue whether symptomatic or silent (asymptomatic).
-TIA: transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction. The symptoms typically last less than 24 hours.
- Noninvasive or invasive arterial imaging test demonstrating 50% stenosis of any of the major extracranial or intracranial vessels to the brain.
- Previous cervical or cerebral artery revascularization surgery or percutaneous intervention.
This does not include chronic (nonvascular) neurological diseases or other acute neurological insults such as metabolic and anoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

# PriorPAD

## Peripheral Arterial Disease

Current or previous history of peripheral arterial disease (includes subclavian, iliac, femoral, and upper- and lower-extremity vessels; excludes renal, coronary, cerebral, and mesenteric vessels and aneurysms). This can include:

- Claudication on exertion
- Amputation for arterial vascular insufficiency
- Vascular reconstruction, bypass surgery, or percutaneous revascularization in the arteries of the extremities
- Positive noninvasive test (e.g., ankle brachial index <= 0.9, ultrasound, MR or CT imaging of >50% diameter stenosis in any peripheral artery (i.e., subclavian, femoral, iliac) or angiographic imaging)

# HxChronicLungDisease

## Chronic Lung Disease

Chronic lung disease can include patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema. It can also include a patient who is currently being chronically treated with inhaled or oral pharmacological therapy (e.g., beta-adrenergic agonist, anti-inflammatory agent, leukotriene receptor antagonist, or steroid). Patients with asthma or seasonal allergies are not considered to have chronic lung disease.

# PriorCABG

## Coronary Artery Bypass Graft

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is when the native vessels of the heart are bypassed with other vessels (internal mammary artery, radial artery or saphenous vein) to restore normal blood flow to the obstructed coronary arteries.
